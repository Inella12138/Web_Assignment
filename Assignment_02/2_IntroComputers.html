		<h4><b>History of Computers</b></h4>
	</body>
	<p>
	One of the earliest machines designed to assist people in
	calculations was the <b>abacus</b> which is still being used some 5000 years after
	its invention. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In 1642 Blaise Pascal (a famous French mathematician) invented an 
	adding machine based on mechanical gears in which numbers were represented
	by the cogsl on the wheels. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Englishman, Charles Babbage, invented in the 1830's a "Difference Engine"
	made out of brass and pewter rods and gears, and also designed a further 
	device which he called an "Analytical Engine".  His design contained the 
	five key characteristics of modern computers:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>An input device</li>
	<li>Storage for numbers waiting to be processed</li>
	<li>A processor or number calculator</li>
	<li>A unit to control the task and the sequence of its calculations</li>
	<li>An output device</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Augusta Ada Byron (later Countess of Lovelace) was an associate of Babbage
	who has become known as the first computer programmer.

	<h4><b>Computer Parts</b></h4>
	<h5><b>Central Processing Unit</b></h5>
	<p>

	A <b>central processing unit(CPU)</b> is the electronic circuitry within a computer 
	that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic 
	arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output(I/O) operations specified 
	by the instructions. 
	The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least 
	since the early 1960s. <sup>[1]</sup>

	<h5><b>Keyboard</b></h5>
	<p>
	<img src="keyboard.jpg"align="right"width="300"hspace="5"vspace="5">
	A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement 
	of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.  
	Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via 
	teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input method for computers. 
	Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have characters engraved or printed on them
	,<sup>[2]</sup> and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol.  
	However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding several keys 
	simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers
	or signs (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions 
	or execute computer commands.  In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text 
	entry interface for typing text and numbers into a word processor, text editor
	or any other program.  In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses 
	is generally left to the software.  Al computer keyboard distinguishes each 
	physical key from every other key and reports all key presses to the controlling 
	software.
